# MLCK-Prover
All data, source code and documentation is provided here.

An interpreter and logic parser for a programming langauge, allowing entry
expressions that can be evaluated either logically or through a series of operators.
It passes user input through a lexer which is then evaluated, parsed and returned.
Both basic and complex features and arithmetic are supported, including string
and numerical operators, equality and inequalities, vector and set operations,
and more. We have also instantiated a prover capable of proving the validity
of predicate logic and quantifier-based expressions.
